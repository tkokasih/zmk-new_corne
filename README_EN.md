# 睫毛外设 (Eyelash Peripherals) Corne ZMK Repository

**This keyboard is not the same as [foostan's Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). It will not work with standard `corne` firmware.**

If you need a 3D model of this keyboard, email `380465425@qq.com`.

## Instructions

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
2. [Click the **Actions** tab and make sure the workflow is enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow#enabling-a-workflow).
3. Make sure the `eyelash_corne` project in [`config/west.yml`](config/west.yml) still works. The `boards/arm/eyelash_corne` folder will be downloaded from this URL.
4. If there is still a `boards/arm/eyelash_corne` folder in your fork, delete it.

**If you already have a ZMK config repository, [you can add this one as a module instead of forking](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules#building-with-modules).**

## Consideration

### Left One-Handed Layer

When right hand is using mouse, left hand should be able to perform, one-handed:
* Number
* Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste
* Tab, Enter, Esc
* Arrows

### Frequent Keys
Thumb cluster should be used for commonly used keys:
* Shift --> Otherwise, need to change hand when doing Shift
* Space --> Very frequent keys

### Two Handed Layer

* Mouse layer
  
  because mouse layer is used when the hands are not on the mouse.
